So a large part of just doing this project is to teach myself how to use the Django framework, so that's what I plan to do. I'm going to get a basic template up first, and read the documentation.

So far: I do not like Django lol. I'm gonna mess with it a bit more, but I've been looking at Ruby and PHP for the next move. I'll see what works best for what.

I added a nice stylesheet, and it was working great, but it all went back downhill once I started to figure out a account system. I think I'm making good progress though, plus I'm getting a lot better with SQL.
